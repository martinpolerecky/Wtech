    <p>Pokemon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. The games are role-playing games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were first released in 1996 in Japan. The games are set in a world inhabited by creatures called Pokemon, which can be captured, trained, and used to battle other trainers. The series has since expanded to include trading card games, an animated television series, movies, and merchandise.

Players are encouraged to trade Pokemon with other players to complete their collection. The games are known for their simple gameplay mechanics, colorful graphics, and catchy music.
