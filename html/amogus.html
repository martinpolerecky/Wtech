    <h2> ඞ THERE IS ONE IMPOSTOR AMONG US ඞ</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Amogus is a 2018 online multiplayer game developed and published by Innersloth. The game takes place in a space-themed setting where players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.
    The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. 
    <br>
    Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.
    The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. 
    <br>
    The game was released for iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms. The game was also released on the Nintendo Switch in December 2020 and has planned releases for the Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in 2021.
    <br>
    The game is free-to-play on Windows and Linux devices, with a paid version on Steam z Lidlu for Mac devices because we need to scam the Apple users somehow.  </p>
